# bredit

The intention was to create a web app, with a Reddit API, that enables the user to view reddit posts and subreddits.

The user will be able to view pictures, videos, comments and the number of upvotes each post has.

The user will be able to view the ID of the commentors.
There will also be a search function that allows one to look for other topics to view in the web app.

The homepage, when loaded, will show the latest posts on the reddit home page.
