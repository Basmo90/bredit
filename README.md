The intention was to create a web app, with a Reddit API, that enables the user to view reddit posts and subreddits.

The user will be able to view pictures, videos, comments and the number of upvotes each post has.

The user will be able to view the ID of the commentors.
There will also be a search function that allows one to look for other topics to view in the web app.

The homepage, when loaded, will show the latest posts on the reddit home page.
If search is used it will return the top ten results.
Comments section is expandable and will show the top ten comments.
Clicking on the title will take you back to the latest top posts.
